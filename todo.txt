TFC AMBIENTAL
- wetness
 - new mechanic, whenever you enter water or rain you are wetted for about an in-game hour (configurable)
 - this effects your temperature, if you are wet you will get colder faster and warmer slower (speed configurable)
 - if you are near a heat source you will dry off faster (only by campfires and stoves and whatnot you can't dry off using just a torch) (speed configurable)
 - this is not a potion effect, it is only shown by water particles dripping off of you
 - if you are wearing clothes you will be wet for longer (toggleable via config, speed configurable)
 - you get wet from entering hot springs, making them slightly less viable for not dying in winter unless you prepare them a bit more (build a sauna or something, man)

- straw knapping
 - similar to clay knapping, but instead uses 10 straw
 - you ever play one of those games where you press one button and the surrounding 4 get toggled too? yeah that's this
 - this is to simulate the springiness of straw
 - this is how you will make the straw hat and new straw clothes: straw poncho, straw greaves
 - better straw hat model (add a brim please)
 - straw clothes kinda suck, but they're better than being naked
 - straw is slightly resistant to being wet
 - you can make wicker with this, an early game armor material

- knitting
 - knitting is how you craft wool knit
 - you now create the wool clothing with this
 - obtained by putting 2 yarn with knitting needles (2 sticks like this: XX)
 - yarn is crafted by putting 4 string in a crafting grid
 - this is to make it slightly easier to make clothes before the winter
 - knitting takes time, you hold down right click and a bar at the bottom slowly progresses
 - inspired by better than wolves' knitting
